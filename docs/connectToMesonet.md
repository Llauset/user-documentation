# Request a MesoNET account

You need to create a MesoNET account to access all MesoNET services.
Account manager is available at https://iam.mesonet.fr

1. Use first the EduGAIN button, select your institution and your institutional identifiers to connect
2. If you do not have an institution present in EduGAIN, you can create a local account at https://iam.mesonet.fr/start-registration

In both cases, you need to choose a username (you future login) and fill your motivation to join.
You will next receive a validation mail (check your spam directory) : you need to clic on the validation link.
Manual validation by a MesoNET administrator will then be required, which may take a few days.
ðŸ’¥NOTE : During this process, you may be confronted with an error message. In this case, please stop and restart your browser.
